# SickLang - A sick experimental programming language

## 1. Why am I building a programming language?

It's a topic which I'm interested about since I've started programming.
I want to learn as much as I can about programming languages, how they're tokenized, parsed, interpreted and compiled.
What problems I will come across by writing all the components by myself and how tools can help my with that later on.
What tools are out there and why I should use them instead of building it myself.

# 2. What have I learned so far?

I've already learned much about this stuff just by building this project, so I want to keep going.
I learned how to turn a senseless string into something that makes sense and can be used to build new stuff.
What flaws there are when you start making a language, and the challenges that come with it.

# 3. Where do i wanna go with this project?
Not so far, just learn how to get the stuff done and move on with new programming languages, where I might use some generators to get faster to the real deal, which is implementing a programming language and not a lexer or paser.
